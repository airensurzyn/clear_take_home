# CLEAR Take Home

## Setup / View:

There are two options for testing out this application:
- View online at [airen.codes](https://www.airen.codes)
- Setup locally


### Local Setup:
- run `git clone https://github.com/airensurzyn/clear_take_home.git` in the directory of your choice
- run `cd client`
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`

This will start up the react project which can run on its own on your local machine.

The server folder is the backend necessary to run the project on Google Cloud. It serves the React index.html from a build folder created at deploy time.
